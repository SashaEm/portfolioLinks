Spacerings is the game I recently published in Google Play.

It is my solo project made under the name of studio.

Spacerings - is the game where player is a ball. The goal is to fly through the rings.

Character is controlled by leaning phone left/right and tapping the screen to jump.

This game has skin shop where you can choose different looks for your character and progress saving system.

Balloon Defender is the project I'm currently working on.

Main feature of this game is that it's a simple Tower Defense game.

You earn money by destroying balloons, place turrets and earn more money.

Once one balloon passes the top of the screen - you lose and your score is displayed.

Duet3D is a 3d version of a game that came out in 2013 "Duet".

This is a game where you control the character that consists of two parts,

you have to think about how one sphere depends from the other and dynamically control their movement.
