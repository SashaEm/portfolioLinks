### Spacerings

Spacerings is the game I recently published in Google Play.

It is my solo project made under the name of studio.

Spacerings - is the game where player is a ball. The goal is to fly through the rings.

Character is controlled by leaning phone left/right and tapping the screen to jump.

This game has skin shop where you can choose different looks for your character and progress saving system.
